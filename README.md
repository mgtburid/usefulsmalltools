# usefulsmalltools
Includes small - or even tiny - programs that can be run on Linux or Windows for small tasks accomplishing which may involve more than referring to some number in GUI.

Currently the following software is available:
1. Directory Contents. Lists contents of the specified directory and writes the result in a separate file in the directory from where the program was initiated.
2. Down Detector. Sends a simple GET request to the specified web-site; if it has a self-signed SSL certificate, Down Detector will not verify it. To help the user realize if the problem lies on the server's side or theirs, Google is also "pinged".
