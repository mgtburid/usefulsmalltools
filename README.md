# usefulsmalltools
Includes small - or even tiny - programs that can be run on Linux and/or Windows for small tasks accomplishing which may involve more than referring to some number in GUI.

Currently, the following software is available:
1. Directory Contents. Lists contents of the specified directory and writes the result in a separate file in the directory from where the program was initiated.
2. Down Detector. Sends a simple GET request to the specified web-site; if it has a self-signed SSL certificate, Down Detector will not verify it. To help the user realize if the problem lies on the server's side or theirs, Google is also pinged.
3. Backup manager will create a .tar archive of the folder or file a user specifies. Script interacts with the user.
4. File Copier will create the number of files user wishes with a certain name and extension.
